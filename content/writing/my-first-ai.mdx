## Game Overview

The Matching card game is a classic memory game where players need to find pairs of matching cards. Here are the basic rules:

- Cards are laid face down on a surface
- Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time
- If two cards match, the player gets a point and player switching turn
- If they don't match, the cards are turned face down again
- The games end when all cards are matched
- The player with the most points win

## Making my first AI

For my matching card game, I want the second opponent to be an AI. I know there's a lot going on with AI these days, but I've never made one before—even the simplest kind. Why? I'm not sure—maybe because I thought it would be really hard, you know, with all the math and stuff. But for this project, I want to give it a try. With the help of the internet and GPTs, I've learned that creating an AI for this game isn't too hard after all.

The basic idea for my AI is that it just needs to remember its moves and the player's moves, and then make decisions based on this memory instead of making random picks for the flipped cards.

```tsx
const makeMove = (card: Item) => {
  updateAIMemory(card);
  handleSelectCard(card);
};

if (Math.random() < mistakeProbability) {
  [firstPick, secondPick] = selectWeightCards(unmathedGlobal, 2);
}

makeMove(firstPick);

const delayTime = Math.random() * 1000 + 1500;
setTimeout(makeMove(secondPick), delayTime);
```

### Weighted Selection

Weighted Selection, also known as weighted random selection or weighted random sampling, is a technique used to randomly choose items from a set where each item has a different probability of being selected. In my context, it's used to select previously seen cards in a way that not purely random, but influenced by certain factors.

```tsx
const selectWeightCards = (cards: Item[], count: number): Item[] => {
  const unseenCards = cards.filter(
    (card) => !aiMemory.some((memCard) => memCard.id === card.id)
  );

  if (unseenCards.length >= count) {
    return shuffleArray(unseenCards).slice(0, count);
  } else {
    const seenCards = aiMemory.filter(
      (card) => !gameState.matchedPairs.has(card.id)
    );

    const weightSelection = weightRandomSelection(
      seenCards,
      calculateWeight,
      count - unseenCards.length
    );
    return [...shuffleArray(unseenCards), ...weightSelection];
  }
};
```

- Basic Concept:
  In a regular random selection, each item has an equal chance of being chosen. In weighted selection, each item assigned a "weight" that influences its probability of selection. Items with higer weights are more likely to be chosen.
- Implementation of weighted selection:

```ts
const calculateWeight = (item: MemoryItem): number => {
  const turnsAgo = turnCounterRef.current - item.lastSeen;
  const baseWeight = Math.max(1, 15 - Math.sqrt(turnsAgo));

  const multipleSeenBonus = Math.min(item.seenCount || 0, 5);

  switch (gameState.difficulty) {
    case "easy":
      return baseWeight * 0.5 + multipleSeenBonus;
    case "medium":
      return baseWeight + multipleSeenBonus;
    case "hard":
      return baseWeight * 1.5 + multipleSeenBonus * 2;
    default:
      return baseWeight;
  }
};
```

The `calculateWeight` function determines how likely the AI is to "remember" and select a particular card in a memory game. It simulates the AI's memory process by considering how recently the AI has seen a card, how often it has encountered it, and adjusts based on the game's difficulty level. In harder difficulties, the AI's "memory" becomes sharper, making it more likely to recall recently and frequently seen cards. This function creates an adaptive AI opponent that can provide an appropriate challenge to the human player, with its "memory skills" scaling based on the chosen difficulty setting.

```ts
function weightRandomSelection<T>(
  items: T[],
  weightFn: (item: T) => number,
  count: number
): T[] {
  const weights = items.map(weightFn);
  const totalWeight = weights.reduce((acc, weight) => acc + weight, 0);

  const selected: T[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    let randomWeight = Math.random() * totalWeight;
    for (let j = 0; j < items.length; j++) {
      randomWeight -= weights[j];
      if (randomWeight <= 0) {
        selected.push(items[j]);
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return selected;
}
```

The `weightRandomSelection` function selects a specified number of items from an array using a weighted probability system, where each item's likelihood of being chosen is determined by a provided weight function.
